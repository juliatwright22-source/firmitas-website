## Session 1 — 2026-07-15

**Built:**
- Scaffolded the full file structure per the build brief: `index.html`, `about.html`, `services.html`, `contact.html`, `faq.html`, `css/variables.css`, `css/styles.css`, `js/includes.js`, `js/nav.js`, `js/main.js`, `partials/header.html`, `partials/footer.html`, `images/`, `design-reference/`.
- Defined brand design tokens in `css/variables.css` (Ink Navy `#0F1B2D`, Limestone `#F2EFE6`, Heritage Gold `#C8A461`, Playfair Display + Archivo).
- Base `styles.css` with reset, typography defaults, `.photo-placeholder`, `.btn-gold`, footer band styling.
- `js/includes.js` fetches `partials/header.html` and `partials/footer.html` into `#site-header` / `#site-footer` mount points on every page.
- Header partial includes nav with primary CTA ("Schedule a Discovery Conversation"). Footer partial includes logo mount, contact placeholders, and LinkedIn/Instagram/Facebook social links only.
- All HTML pages are structural shells with section comments marking what goes where — no real copy written yet, per the sitemap-confirmation step in the brief.
- Initialized git and made the first commit (scaffold only, before any real content).

**Pending / needs Julia's input before further build:**
1. **Mood board images** — Section 4.5 of the brief calls for saving the mood board images into `design-reference/` and attaching them directly to the chat. No images were attached in this session. `design-reference/` folder exists and is ready — please add the brand mood board sheet, the "Clarity is a competitive advantage" compass ad, the pillar/column sketch, the mountain-summit graphic, and the monogram close-up.
2. **Interim logo files** — `images/logo-primary.png`, `images/logo-monogram.png`, `images/favicon.png` are referenced in the header/footer partials but do not exist yet. Save the AI-generated placeholder logo images into `images/` with those exact filenames.
3. **Sitemap confirmation** — the proposed sitemap (Home, About, Services, Contact, FAQ) matches Section 6 of the brief. Confirm before full content is written, especially whether FAQ should be a standalone page or a section on About/Contact.
4. **GitHub repo** — not yet created. Per the brief, use VS Code's Source Control panel → "Publish to GitHub", named `firmitas-website`.
5. **Netlify** — not yet connected. Do this after the GitHub repo exists.
6. **Contact form handling** — still undecided (Netlify Forms vs. external scheduler link). `contact.html` has no submission logic wired up yet.
7. **Real contact info** — phone/email are `[PHONE NUMBER — ASK JULIA]` / `[EMAIL — ASK JULIA]` placeholders in the footer.
8. **Domain** — likely `firmitas.life`, needs exact confirmation before use in metadata or Netlify.
9. **Founder bio specifics** — whether to name past employers, or keep generic — not yet decided.

**Not built (intentionally, per brief):**
- No Insights/Articles section.
- No gated membership area.
- No pricing anywhere.
- No ICF-certified language — founder is pursuing the credential, not yet certified.

**Next session should:** confirm sitemap + placement of FAQ, then build out `index.html` homepage content first (per the approved section flow), followed by About, Services, Contact.

## Session 2 — 2026-07-15

**Built:**
- Julia added 8 mood board images to `design-reference/` (6 AI-generated ad/lockup mockups + a brand sheet + a full-page site mockup). Reviewed all of them — confirmed the monogram F, shield/crest, icon triad (column/compass/mountain), and several on-brand taglines ("Leadership that lasts.", "Built on truth. Driven by purpose. / Built to stand.", "Clarity is a competitive advantage.").
- Flagged that the full-page mockup (`designreference2.jpg`) includes fake client logos (Apple, IBM, McKinsey, Microsoft), a team/headshots section, and YouTube/TikTok icons — per the brief these are placeholder filler and were **not** carried into the real build (founder-only About page, no fabricated client logos, no YouTube/TikTok since Firmitas has no active accounts there).
- Initially replaced the `<img>` logo references with a CSS text wordmark, since the mood board images are full marketing composites (ad copy, photography, icon rows baked in), not isolated logo cutout files. Then Julia added `images/logo-mark.svg` — an actual vectorized F monogram (clean single-path navy SVG, not a mockup) — renamed it to `images/logo-monogram.svg` to match the brief's naming convention. Header/footer now pair that real monogram with the text wordmark; footer version uses a CSS `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)` to render it white against the navy background. All 5 pages' `<link rel="icon">` now point at the same SVG as an interim favicon.
- Built out `index.html` in full — all 9 approved homepage sections (Hero → Icon triad/portrait → Leadership Reality → What Firmitas Does → Biblical Foundation → Who We Serve → Coaching Options → Why Firmitas → Founder Credibility → Final Invitation) using the approved draft copy plus new copy for the "Who We Serve" cards, written in the established Firmitas voice.
- Added full supporting CSS to `styles.css`: header/nav (incl. mobile toggle), hero, icon triad, feature row, card grid, two-column layout, CTA band, footer — all built from the `variables.css` design tokens.
- Icon triad (Strength/Direction/Legacy) implemented as inline gold-stroke SVGs (column, compass, mountain) rather than image files, since no icon assets exist yet.
- Verified all pages/partials/CSS/JS serve correctly with a local static server (all 200s, includes.js relative paths resolve). No visual/browser check was possible in this environment — recommend Julia open the site via VS Code Live Server (or after Netlify deploy) to confirm the actual rendered layout.
- Julia also added `images/jonathanimage1.jpg` — an actual headshot of founder Jonathan LaBoube. Wired it into the homepage founder-credibility section (`.founder-photo`, `object-fit: cover`) in place of the gray placeholder box the brief originally specified — that guidance assumed no headshot existed yet, which is no longer true.
- Committed: scaffold commit `6000851`, homepage build commit (see `git log`).

**Pending / needs Julia's input — carried over:**
1. Logo — real monogram SVG now in use (`images/logo-monogram.svg`); still waiting on a full lockup/wordmark SVG if Julia has one, and on a light/white-native version if the CSS invert-filter trick on the footer ever looks off.
2. GitHub repo not yet published (VS Code Source Control → "Publish to GitHub", name `firmitas-website`).
3. Netlify not yet connected — do after GitHub is up.
4. Sitemap confirmed by Julia in principle; she may still revise pages/layout later — nothing here is locked in.
5. Contact form handling method (Netlify Forms vs. external scheduler) — still undecided, `contact.html` has no submission logic.
6. Real phone/email — still placeholder text in the footer.
7. Domain spelling (`firmitas.life`?) — still needs exact confirmation.
8. Founder bio specifics (name past employers or stay generic) — still undecided; current homepage bio uses the generic version from the brief.
9. Real photography — hero section still has no image (solid navy background); the homepage's icon-triad portrait is still a gray placeholder box. Founder headshot is now real (see below).

- Julia confirmed only `index.html` has real content — `about.html`, `services.html`, `contact.html`, `faq.html` are still empty shells; flagged this explicitly since an earlier summary may have implied more was done.
- Checked `images/` for a "new signature F logo" Julia mentioned — it's the same `logo-monogram.svg` already wired in during this session, not a separate file.
- Added a **Video & Animation** workflow section to `README.md` (Julia's addendum): AI-generated clips (e.g. Higgsfield) go in a new `videos/` folder, must be compressed (<5MB, MP4/H.264), embedded via native `<video>` with a poster fallback, no autoplay on mobile, must respect `prefers-reduced-motion`, used sparingly (one hero moment, not a default treatment), and never fabricated/sourced by Claude — only real files Julia provides. Created the empty `videos/` folder (with `.gitkeep` so git tracks it). No video files exist yet — nothing to embed.
- Committed: `5c41ef4` (video/animation docs + folder).

**Pending / needs Julia's input — carried over:**
1. Logo — real monogram SVG in use; still waiting on a full lockup/wordmark SVG if one exists, and a light/white-native version if the CSS invert-filter trick ever looks off.
2. GitHub repo not yet published.
3. Netlify not yet connected.
4. Contact form handling method (Netlify Forms vs. external scheduler) — undecided.
5. Real phone/email — still placeholder text in the footer.
6. Domain spelling (`firmitas.life`?) — needs exact confirmation.
7. Founder bio specifics (name past employers or stay generic) — undecided.
8. Real photography — hero section and icon-triad portrait still have no image.
9. No video clips provided yet — workflow is documented and ready whenever Julia has one.

**Next session should:** build out `about.html`, `services.html`, `contact.html`, `faq.html` using the same section/copy approach, once Julia confirms sitemap/FAQ placement and the still-open decisions above.

## Session 3 — 2026-07-15

**Redesign to match the mood-board look (Julia: "I really don't like how it looks… mirror and match those elements").** Julia confirmed three decisions up front: (1) use the AI mood-board images as real site imagery for now, (2) build the full site, all five pages, (3) keep the brief's exclusions excluded (no fake client logos, no team section, no blog, no map).

**Built:**
- Cropped clean photographic regions out of the mood-board composites (avoiding baked-in ad text) into `images/`: `hero-mountain.jpg` (summit figure, from Image 12), `column-dark.jpg` (stone column in dramatic light, from Image 11), `compass-navy.jpg` (brass compass on navy, from Image 14), `column-sketch.jpg` (architectural pencil sketch, from Image 13). These are interim — swap for licensed/original photography before heavy promotion.
- Rebuilt the design system in `variables.css` + `styles.css` to match the references: limestone canvas site-wide (body is no longer white), warm paper/limestone/navy section rhythm, navy gradient bands with top light, signature short gold hairline rule (`.gold-rule`), letterspaced gold uppercase eyebrows, serif italic gold accent lines, sharp corners everywhere, gold-top-accent cards with hover lift, offset gold photo frame (`.framed-photo`), column-sketch background treatment (`.section--sketch`), split hero, interior `page-hero` (centered + split variants), service detail rows, FAQ accordion, navy contact form card, 3-column footer with gold top border and "Strength. Stability. Direction." tagline band.
- Restyled `index.html` (same approved copy, new structure): split hero with mountain photo, triad + column photo section, sketch-backed Leadership Reality, navy Biblical Foundation, cards, compass-panel Why Firmitas ("Clarity is a competitive advantage." accent), framed founder photo, navy CTA band.
- Built out all four remaining pages in the new system:
  - `about.html` — name meaning (Vitruvius: firmitas/utilitas/venustas), founder story (generic bio, no employer names, no ICF language), Strength/Direction/Legacy philosophy triad, purpose quote band ("We partner with leaders to build unshakable foundations and lasting impact." — from the brand sheet).
  - `services.html` — four service detail rows (no pricing; "investment discussed in the discovery conversation"), "How it begins" navy section with compass panel.
  - `contact.html` — discovery-conversation framing + navy form card (name/email/org &amp; role/message). **Form is intentionally NOT wired to any submission logic** — Netlify Forms vs. scheduler still undecided.
  - `faq.html` — 8 Q&amp;As written in the Firmitas voice. **DRAFT — Julia must check these against the approved Q&amp;A language in brief Section 8.6**; I did not have the brief text in this session.
- Footer partial updated (3-column layout + tagline band); `nav.js` now marks the current page's nav link (gold underline via `[aria-current]`).
- Fixed founder headshot cropping (nearly-square source; now `aspect-ratio: 4/5`, `object-position: center 30%`).
- Verified in live preview at desktop + narrow widths: all five pages, nav active states, FAQ accordion open/close, no console errors.

**Pending / needs Julia's input — carried over:**
1. Contact form handling (Netlify Forms vs. external scheduler) — form UI exists, not wired.
2. Real phone/email — still placeholders in the footer.
3. FAQ copy — draft only, check against brief Section 8.6.
4. GitHub repo + Netlify — still not set up.
5. Domain spelling confirmation.
6. Real photography to eventually replace the cropped AI mood-board images.
7. Social links are still `#` placeholders.
